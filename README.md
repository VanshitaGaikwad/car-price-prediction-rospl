## Introduction

This project aims to predict the prices of used cars by utilizing a dataset from Kaggle. It involves using various machine learning models for regression, such as Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression, to predict the prices of used cars based on a set of features.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python >= version 3.8
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (`Predicting used car prices.ipynb`) to access the code and follow along with the project.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle. You can download it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/avikasliwal/used-cars-price-prediction). Make sure to download and place the dataset in the appropriate location before running the notebook.

## Data Exploration

In this section of the notebook, the dataset is loaded, and basic information about the data is displayed. This includes a glimpse of the dataset, summary statistics, and the data types of each column.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in this project. It involves cleaning and transforming the dataset to make it suitable for machine learning. Some of the key preprocessing steps include:

- Handling missing values
- Extracting relevant information from columns
- Creating dummy variables for categorical data
- Scaling the data for better model performance

## Training and Predicting

The project uses two different regression models to make predictions: Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression. Both models are trained on the preprocessed data, and their performance is evaluated using the R-squared (R2) score.

## Results

The results of the machine learning models are displayed in the notebook. The Random Forest Regression model outperforms the Linear Regression model, achieving an R2 score of 0.88, indicating its better predictive capability.
